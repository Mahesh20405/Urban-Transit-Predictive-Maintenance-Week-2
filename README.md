# Urban Transit Predictive Maintenance Week 2

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for the second week of the Predictive Maintenance project using NYC Taxi Trip data. This phase involved advanced preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with generating insights from the results.

## Project Overview
The focus was on analyzing NYC Taxi Trip data, including trip distance, fare amount, and passenger count, to predict maintenance needs. Key aspects included model training and evaluation.

## Advanced Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for the model.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Model Training**: Implementing and training a model on the preprocessed data.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 Score.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Actual vs. Predicted RUL**: Compares predicted Remaining Useful Life with actual values.
   - **Distribution of Trip Duration**: Shows the frequency distribution of trip lengths.
   - **Correlation Matrix**: Displays relationships between features.
   - **Feature Importance**: Highlights the significance of each feature in the model.
